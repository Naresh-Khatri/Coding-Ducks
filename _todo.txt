    - I have spent way too much time researching for various ways to add multiplayer
        functionaly on the editor. I was spectical for using Yjs and wanted to implement
        my own CRDT. Realised that its not an easy job even with Automerge. So after almost
        10 days of no result I ended up using Yjs ALONG WITH the editor binding
    - Also I have realised that going with monaco was initially temping and was 
        easier experience but I wanted to chanllenge myself and build the custom editors
        with CodeMirror6. I really like the overall architecture of it (though i dont
        understand it fully).  So, friendship with Ace and Monaco has ended and Codemirror
        is my new best friend

    - I have searched for many online IDEs with terminal support but it looks like 
        huge work (docker, hyper, FS or DB, file imports, kubernetes?). 
    - Now my only focus is on 2 options. 
        1. Web editor
            - this will only have 3 tabs html, css and js with output just like codepen
        2. Blank
            - here you can create a FS and run any language but imports not available
    - Hopefully this will be done by today. cya tonight

    - check all components when user is not loaded

    - Since im unable to create a persistent store layer for pg i 
        have decided to keep 2 sources of truth for room contnets
        - one is ydoc which is persistent in leveldb on server    
        - other is plain text(contentHTML, ..CSS, ..JS) for guestmode
    - add a middleware to check presnt in room before updating it
